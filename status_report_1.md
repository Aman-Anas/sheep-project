- **Andrew:** Andrew has added GoDotTest to the project dependencies to prepare for unit testing. He also added a basic .NET build & test workflow to see how we might be able to use GitHub Actions in CI/CD.

## Next steps
- **Aman:**
- **Andrew:** In the next sprint, Andrew plans to set up the Ansible playbook for the deployment part of the pipeline, in addition to adding the infrastructure for the linting step. It is expected that the Ansible playbook will take 3–5 days and the linting step will also take at least 3 days.

## Retrospective
- **Aman:**
- **Andrew:** Andrew had some troubles getting his environment set up and found a resource usage concern with the title screen, but has the project dependencies set up and found a workaround for cycling through the debug menu to monitor performance metrics. He had also planned on adding branch protection and GitHub Actions runners before realizing he didn't have access to those settings on NC State's GitHub Enterprise instance. For the next sprint, he plans to "begin with the end in mind" and resolve access issues before investing time in learning about how to accomplish a task.
